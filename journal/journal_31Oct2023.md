## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
For what  I understand containers allow to reproduce ones workflows by wnsuring the same  "environment" is used consistently which sounds like a great option in general which I find very interesting


### Bud: 
Would look forward to follow the recorded session for last week to try and get some practical experience in creating a container, 
for what I understand for the material, version control is also something that can be improved with containers which is something I could use.


### Thorn: 
I found it hard to grasp the concept of the "dependencies" of containers itself and the role on reproducibility, 
I guess this might be something that can be clarified if I can practice and put into action  to see their role in reproducibility for my work in particular. 
Additionally I understood that they can also help with peer colaboration. However this is something that is hard to visualize for me as I do most of my work alone, 
it would be very interesting to explore that more since  there will need to be a transfer of work once I graduate next summer.
