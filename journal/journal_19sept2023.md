### Rose:

I learnt a lot about Open Science.  For e.g. about open access, open data, open peer review.  I did not know earlier about open peer review or open access. Got to know about open science communities like TOPS, the turing way etc. 

### Bud: 

In one of our research project, we are collecting data related to health from various sources. We are planning to open source it once it's done. That will be our contribution to Open Data.

### Thorn: 
Not anything like that as of now.
