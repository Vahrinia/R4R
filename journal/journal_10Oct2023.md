### Rose:
This week's session was a valuable "reinforcement" but also expanding view of the different tools we can use for documentation and comunication of our work. 
I havent really put much though to what types of documentation I usually work with so it was insightfull to reflect on that aspect of research but also on what type of documentation we generate

### Bud: 
"Building a GitHub Pages Website using MkDocs" is something I am currently behind and has my interest for deeper exploration and customization. Additionally as I have mentioned in previous journals 
I often struggle with Version control so its very interesting to continue to see how parts of each session talk about parts of  the research (management, documentation data organization) and improved practices that are transferable to my issue 
and can in consequence help me organize my work better

### Thorn: 
As a newcommer to the github world and crearting my own website, it can be a bit overwhelming to look at the information or tutorial because of how much information we have to go over in the two hour sessions. However, being able to 
go back to the recordings really supports my exploring of the topics at whatever pace I need specially when sometimes I can get lost on language familiarity of these tools, platforms etc.

## Additional thought
Appreciated Michele staying for a bit longer to share more details on how to work on the "assignment" portion of the session
