# Learner Log Entry #1 

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
Getting a nice overview of how the terminal works and how to use Git

### Bud: 
Getting to practice what we learned and use command lines so much I have them memorized and don't have to look them up each time

### Thorn: 
Seeing the issues that come up when there are users with different operating systems/set-ups

## Additional thought
Just want to make sure I use this skills enough, repeatedly over time so that I can use command line and Git without even having to think about it.
